FileCast - Zero setup, cross platform desktop to mobile file transfer tool
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Everyday problem: a file needs to be copied from a desktop computer to
a mobile device (or another desktop computer somewhere on the internet).

FileCast provides a simple, hassle free solution for sharing files and 
directories through it's build-in webserver. All that is needed on the mobile
device is a webbrowser and optionally a QR code scanner app for easily 
copying the download url.
